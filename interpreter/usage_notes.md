# Interpreter Pattern
Good for interfacing between discreet chunks of code that otherwise have trouble talking to each other. The concept uses an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to obtain the action you are looking for.

## Uses
Examples: the Ruby language, regular expressions, the Runt library

## Pros
You can build up a highly-flexible library of tools that can be interchanged as needed.

## Cons
It has a lot of moving parts.
