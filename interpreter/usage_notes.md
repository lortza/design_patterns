# Interpreter Pattern
Good for interfacing between discreet chunks of code that otherwise have trouble talking to each other.

## Uses
Examples: the Ruby language, regular expressions, the Runt library

## Pros
You can build up a highly-flexible library of tools that can be interchanged as needed.

## Cons
It has a lot of moving parts.
