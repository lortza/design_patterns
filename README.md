# Design Patterns (in Ruby)

This repo is a sandbox tool for me as I work my way through learning the design patterns in Ruby as described by Russ Olsen in his book _[Design Patterns in Ruby](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2278064.Design_Patterns_in_Ruby)_.

## Patterns
- Abstract Factory Method
- [Adapter](/Adapter): An object that spans the gap between the interface you have and the interface you need. You get encapsulation at the cost of complexity.
- Builder
- [Command](/command): separate the action bits into their own object that's separate from the static bits.
- [Composite](/composite): build bigger objects out of smaller objects and allow methods to cascade. Uses 1 level of inheritance.
- Decorator
- Factory Method
- Interpreter
- [Iterator](/iterator): iterate over objects inside of a black box
- [Observer](/observer): automatically notify observing objects when an object changes.
- Proxy
- [Proxy](/proxy): wip
- [Template Method](/template_method): allows you to customize the steps of a process without changing the process. Uses inheritance.
- Singleton
- [Strategy](/strategy): pull the algorithm out into a separate object.
