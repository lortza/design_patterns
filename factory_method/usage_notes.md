# Factory_method Pattern

## Uses
Solving the problem of picking the right class for the circumstances.

## Pros
It does a nice job of separating concerns. It gives flexibility in the abilty to pass in different kinds of classes which can't happen with highly-coupled code.

## Cons
It can start to feel complex with the different layers of classes being built. It is easy to overengineer something that could maybe just cope with having a couple of classes for a little while. 

## This repo
This repo has several different examples of implementing different leves of complexity with a factory method.
