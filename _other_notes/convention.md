# Convention over Configuration

## Uses
Brought to us by the Rails framework, this approach allows users (engineers) to step into a codebase and get up to speed quickly.

### Example

## Pros
* reduces the unknown and allows engineers to step into codebases more easily because things are in expected places or follow expected patterns

## Cons

## Notes
A good user interface...
* anticipates the user's need by making common tasks easy to accomplish. It may even make the most common scenario happen by default. Don't give equal weight to all interactions.
* allows the user to be DRY. Consider grouping like files into a folder, so users don't have to name each file with that commonality in mind.
* provides a starter template for the basic, repeatable, known things
